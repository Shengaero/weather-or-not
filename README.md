# Weather or Not

## Description
Have you ever woke up and realized you didn't have time to watch the news to figure out the weather and checking the forecast on your phone just gives a vague desription? This weather application was made in order to make figuring out what to bring or wear outside just a tinsy bit easier. This app will tell you if you need to bring an umbrella, coat or anything else for your day to day activities. No longer will you go outside expecting a normal day just to get drenched because you didnt think a 35% chance of rain would turn into a downpour. Our weather app takes information from the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) and the [Nominatim geocoding API](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/api/Overview/) to get up-to-date weather forecasts for your current location. It also includes some extra functionality to log your city and track the weather on an hourly timeframe. More functionality to come in a later patch/update.

Other libraries used include:
- [Dayjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/dayjs)
- [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/about.html)

## Usage

When a user opens the page, they will have the option to give the page access to their current location. If they do, information for their current city will display on the page. If they don't, or if a user just wants to look at a different location, they can enter a location in the "Enter City" search box. The front page display will then show information for that searched city. The user can also choose to enter the advanced search section of the app, which allows them to choose how long of a forecast they are looking for, as well as the times of day they want for a choosen city.

In addition, there are links to the project github and an "About Us" page, which features a description of the application, and links to github profiles for each member of the team.
